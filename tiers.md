# Tiers

In dAngel Fund, transparency and fairness are the main key issues we care for. We have created a tier scheme to allow $dAngel stakers (15 days) to participate in upcoming IDOs.

| **Tiers** |  **Staked $dAngel**  | **Pool Weight** | **Type**                        |
| --------- | -------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Tier 1    | 2,500                | 1               | lottery (20% chance of winning) |
| Tier 2    | 50,000               | 2               | lottery (50% chance of winning) |
| Tier 3    | 12,500               | 6               | guaranteed                      |
| Tier 4    | 25,000               | 14              | guaranteed                      |
| Tier 5    | 50,000               | 30              | guaranteed                      |
| Tier 6    | 125,000              | 80              | guaranteed                      |
| Tier 7    | 250,000              | 175             | guaranteed                      |

IDO Allocation is calculated according to the tier of participants. Tier 1 and tier 2 are lottery-based tiers, in which the number of participants is calculated by a predetermined chance of winning.

**For tiers between 3 and 7, allocation will be guaranteed.**

Fund allocation per participant will be calculated by pool weight for all tiers.

**Letâ€™s assume there is a total of 13,223 people, according to the breakdown below:**

Tier 1: 9,000; tier 2: 3,000, tier 3: 750, tier 4: 375, tier 5: 45, tier 6: 38, tier 7: 15.

The total weight will be 31,765. The exemplary calculation for tier 3: Pool weight per participant = 6, number of participants = 750. The total weight of tier 3 will be 4,500.

Allocation per weight will be $31.48 (**total IDO = $1,000,000 / total weight = 31,765**). Allocation per tier 3 participant will be $188.88 (allocation per weight = $31.48 x pool weight per participant = 6).
