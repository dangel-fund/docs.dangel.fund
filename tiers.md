# Tiers

At dAngel Fund, transparency and impartiality are the focal issues we care for. Thus, we have generated a tier scheme to permit $dAngel stakers (15 days) to partake in upcoming IDOs.

| **Tiers** |  **Staked $dAngel**  | **Pool Weight** | **Type**                        |
| --------- | -------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Tier 1    | 2,000                | 1               | lottery (20% chance of winning) |
| Tier 2    | 4,000                | 2               | lottery (20% chance of winning) |
| Tier 3    | 10,000               | 5               | guaranteed                      |
| Tier 4    | 17,500               | 9               | guaranteed                      |
| Tier 5    | 35,000               | 16              | guaranteed                      |
| Tier 6    | 90,000               | 32              | guaranteed                      |
| Tier 7    | 175,000              | 52              | guaranteed                      |

IDO Allocation has been determined according to the tier of participants. Tier 1 and tier 2 are lottery-based tiers, in which the number of participants is calculated by a predetermined chance of winning.

For tiers between 3 and 7, allocation will be guaranteed.

Fund allocation per participant will be calculated by pool weight for inclusive tiers.

Letâ€™s assume there are 13,223 people participating in a project, according to the breakdown below:

Tier 1: 9,000; tier 2: 3,000, tier 3: 750, tier 4: 375, tier 5: 45, tier 6: 38, tier 7: 15.

The total weight will be 24,841. The exemplary calculation for tier 3: Pool weight per participant = 5, number of participants = 750. The total weight of tier 3 will be 3,750.
