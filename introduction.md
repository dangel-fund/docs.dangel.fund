# Introduction

dAngel Fund is an ecosystem of entrepreneurs, investors, project teams, and technology partners with mechanisms that support one another while also providing benefits to all parties involved.

The main components of dAngel Fund are;

* Launchpad
* Staking
* Funding Pool
* DAO
* Solution Partners Program
* Community Rewards

These aspects were intended to create win-win scenarios for the stakeholders participating in our ecosystem of

* Entrepreneurs, innovators, and project teams
* dAngel investors i.e, token holders and stakers
* Council members
* Blockchain ecosystem products & services

We will go through all of the major product features and methods of the dAngel Fund ecosystem one by one in this whitepaper, and within each section, we will look at how the parties in our ecosystem interact and earn mutual benefits through these specific dynamics.

While the elements mentioned in this whitepaper are the base versions of the dAngel Fund ecosystem, our DAO will start from the early days of release to go over all the details of user interfaces, processes, and numerical metrics with our community, allowing us to release products that have been thoroughly tested and improved through community feedback loops.

As a result, community-driven input and DAO voting will serve as the backbone of not just our launchpad system, but also the dAngel Fund ecosystem's own product development cycles.

We believe genuine decentralization, in combination with community-driven procedures, will always remain at the heart of the dAngel Fund ecosystem and product development cycles.
