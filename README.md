# Introduction

A decentralized angel fund is critical in order to comprehend particular aspects of crypto fundraising through three focal participants: retail consumers, institutional investors as well as projects.

Projects raise funds in a market that rewards shillers rather than its creators. Legitimate initiatives are unobtainable through necessary resources in order to implement due to excessive fees and imposed platform-rent-seeking economics, all whilst futile whitepapers benefit considerably. Projects must raise finances on a tight timeline, rather than prioritize development. Why should a launchpad compel IPOs after Demo Day? For instance, ‘YCombinator’ does not push IPOs after Demo Day, thus, why should a launchpad? Hence why we are building dAngel Fund. Decentralized Angel (dAngel) Fund is an IDO launchpad platform with an ecosystem of entrepreneurs, investors, project teams, and technology partnerships in order to create a connection through DAO mechanisms directly.

Main components of dAngel Fund are:

1. Launchpad&#x20;
2. Staking&#x20;
3. $50M Funding Pool for main components and tokenomics for projects&#x20;
4. DAO for managing the fund&#x20;
5. Solution partner programs&#x20;
6. Community rewards

These aspects were intended to create successfully balanced outcomes for the stakeholders participating in dAngel Funds ecosystem of:&#x20;

* Entrepreneurs, innovators, and project teams&#x20;
* dAngel investors i.e, token holders and stakers&#x20;
* Council members&#x20;
* Blockchain ecosystem products & services&#x20;

We will uncover the major product features and methods of the dAngel Fund ecosystem explicitly throughout this whitepaper, and within each section we will verify how the parties in our ecosystem interact and earn mutual benefits through aforementioned specified dynamics.

While the elements mentioned in this whitepaper are the base versions of the dAngel Fund ecosystem, our DAO will commence from the initial release in order to analyse the details of user interfaces, processes, and numerical metrics with our community, allowing us to release products that have been rigorously tested and enhanced through community feedback loops.

As a result, community-driven input and DAO voting will serve as the backbone of not just our launchpad system, but also the dAngel Fund ecosystem's own product development cycles.We maintain that authentic decentralization, in union with community-driven procedures, will invariably persist at the heart of the dAngel Fund ecosystem and product development cycles.
