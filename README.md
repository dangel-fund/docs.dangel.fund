# Introduction

It's crucial to understand why we need a decentralized angel fund by describing the present pain points of crypto fundraising for the three main groups of participants: retail consumers, institutional investors, and projects.

Projects raise funds in a market that rewards shillers rather than creators. Legitimate initiatives are unable to obtain necessary resources to implement due to excessive fees and imposed platform-rent-seeking economics, while useless whitepapers raise millions. Projects must also raise finances on a tight timeline, rather than prioritizing development. Why should a launchpad compel IPOs after Demo Day? YCombinator, for example, doesn't push IPOs after Demo Day, so why should a launchpad? This is why we are building dAngel Fund. Decentralized Angel (dAngel) Fund is an IDO launchpad platform with ecosystem of entrepreneurs, investors, project teams, and technology partners to connect each other through DAO mechanisms.

dAngel Fund is an ecosystem of entrepreneurs, investors, project teams, and technology partners with mechanisms that support one another while also providing benefits to all parties involved.

The main components of dAngel Fund are;

* Launchpad
* Staking
* Funding Pool
* DAO
* Solution Partners Program
* Community Rewards

These aspects were intended to create win-win scenarios for the stakeholders participating in our ecosystem of

* Entrepreneurs, innovators, and project teams
* dAngel investors i.e, token holders and stakers
* Council members
* Blockchain ecosystem products & services

We will go through all of the major product features and methods of the dAngel Fund ecosystem one by one in this whitepaper, and within each section, we will look at how the parties in our ecosystem interact and earn mutual benefits through these specific dynamics.

While the elements mentioned in this whitepaper are the base versions of the dAngel Fund ecosystem, our DAO will start from the early days of release to go over all the details of user interfaces, processes, and numerical metrics with our community, allowing us to release products that have been thoroughly tested and improved through community feedback loops.

As a result, community-driven input and DAO voting will serve as the backbone of not just our launchpad system, but also the dAngel Fund ecosystem's own product development cycles.

We believe genuine decentralization, in combination with community-driven procedures, will always remain at the heart of the dAngel Fund ecosystem and product development cycles.
