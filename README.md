# \[R1] Staking Process of $DAF

In this part, we would like to explain the step-by-step approach to staking your $DAF. The staking works with a simple user interface, and workflow, so anyone without any technical knowledge can start to stake and unstake their $DAF tokens.

&#x20;

Here is the step by step journey for staking your $DAL tokens;

1. Connect your wallet (Metamask and more wallets coming soon) to dangel.fund website
2. See your $DAF token amount in the staking section.
3. Type the number of tokens you want to stake, and press submit button.
4. Click Stake & Lock button in the staking section.
5. Accept the confirmation in your connected wallet.
6. Once the transaction is complete, see a popup in stake area in the website displaying your current $DAF tokens that are staking.

For the whitelisting process of upcoming IDOs, 7 days of staking is required, and during 7 days period, you canâ€™t unlock your $DAF tokens. After 7 days, you can unstake and unlock your tokens without any loss.

We will be providing longer time options other than 7-days-staking to allow you to get $DAF token rewards. While this workflow is the base user experience of dAngel Fund staking mechanism, we will continue to add more robust features according to feedbacks that come from our community, and stakers.

For our ecosystem, we will be implementing smart contracts that $DAF stakers can also stake tokens of the projects from our launchpad and this will be counted in tier allocation as well. We will be sharing the mechanism in Q2 2022.
