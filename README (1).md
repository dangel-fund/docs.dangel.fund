We will provide longer time options (other than 15-days-staking) to authorize acquired $dAngel token rewards. While this workflow is the base user experience of dAngel Fund staking mechanism, we will continue to add more robust features according to feedbacks received by our community and stakers alike. For our ecosystem, implementation of smart contracts will be included so that $dAngel stakers may also stake tokens of the projects from our launchpad - this will be counted in tier allocation as well.
