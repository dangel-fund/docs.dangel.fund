# Funding Pool

$50M Funding Pool is the main treasury fund allocated for new projects in dAngel Fund Launchpad. As stated on our Tokenomics page, 25% of all the $dAngel tokens are allocated for the funding pool and will be used as the primary pool to fund projects.

Distribution of tokens received from project fundings:

In order to sustain our funding pool and fund new projects, 50% of tokens received from fundings will be allocated to the funding pool. 25% of the tokens acquired from the projects will be allocated to stakers. The remaining 25% of the tokens will be allocated towards dAngel Fund operations in order to advance and expand our operations and team through marketing and further development purposes to subsidize the dAngel Fund ecosystem.
