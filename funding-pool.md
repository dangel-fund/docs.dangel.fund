# Funding Pool

Funding Pool is the main treasury fund allocated for new projects in dAngel Fund Launchpad.

As stated on our Tokenomics page, 40% of all the $dAngel tokens are allocated for the funding pool and will be used as the primary pool to fund projects.

Each project that has been selected for launching through the launchpad will receive $100,000 in exchange for 2% of the tokens from the funded projects.

**Distribution of the 2% tokens generated from project fundings**

In order to sustain our funding pool and fund new projects, 50% of these tokens generated from fundings, will be allocated to the funding pool.

25% of the tokens generated from the projects will be allocated to stakers. And the remaining 25% of the tokens will be allocated to dAngel Fund operations so that we can grow our work and team for marketing and development purposes to help the dAngel Fund ecosystem.
