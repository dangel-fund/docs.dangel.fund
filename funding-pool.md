# Funding Pool

Funding Pool is the main treasury fund allocated for new projects in dAngel Fund Launchpad.

As stated on our Tokenomics page, 25% of all the $dAngel tokens are allocated for the funding pool and will be used as the primary pool to fund projects.

Selected projects will receive an investment from dAngel Fund in exchange for tokens from the funded projects.

Distribution of tokens received from project fundings

In order to sustain our funding pool and fund new projects, 50% of these tokens received from fundings, will be allocated to the funding pool.\
25% of the tokens received from the projects will be allocated to stakers. And the remaining 25% of the tokens will be allocated to dAngel Fund operations so that we can grow our work and team for marketing and development purposes to help the dAngel Fund ecosystem.
